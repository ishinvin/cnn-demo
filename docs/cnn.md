## 🕰️ Background and History of CNNs

### 🧬 Origins of Neural Networks

- **1958**: The **Perceptron**, developed by **Frank Rosenblatt**, was an early neural network model capable of learning simple binary classifiers.
- **1986**: **Backpropagation** was popularized by **Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams**, enabling multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to be trained more effectively.

### 👁️ Birth of CNNs: LeNet-5

- In the late 1980s and 1990s, **Yann LeCun** introduced **LeNet-5**, one of the first convolutional neural networks.
- Used by the US Postal Service to read handwritten ZIP codes.
- Structure:
  - Input → Convolution → Subsampling (Pooling) → Fully Connected → Output
- Introduced **weight sharing** and local receptive fields, drastically reducing model complexity for image inputs.

### 🧠 Biological Inspiration

- CNNs are inspired by the **visual cortex** of animals.
- Neurons in the visual cortex respond to stimuli in small, overlapping regions of the visual field — similar to convolutional filters.

### 🚀 CNNs and the Deep Learning Revolution

#### 🏆 Key Milestone: AlexNet (2012)

- **Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey Hinton**
- Won the **ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)** with a top-5 error of 15%, compared to 26% for the next best.
- Innovations:
  - **ReLU activation**
  - **Dropout** for regularization
  - **Data augmentation**
  - **GPU training**

#### 🔧 Modern Architectures:

- **VGGNet (2014)**: Very deep networks using 3x3 convolutions.
- **GoogLeNet/Inception (2014)**: Inception modules for efficient computation.
- **ResNet (2015)**: Introduced residual connections (skip connections) to ease training of deep networks.

### 🌍 CNNs in the Real World

Used in:

- Medical imaging (tumor detection)
- Autonomous driving (object/lane recognition)
- Face recognition
- Image search and recommendation
- Social media (auto-tagging, moderation)

## 1. What is a Neural Network?

### 💡 Key Concepts

- Mimics the human brain to detect patterns.
- Layers: **Input → Hidden → Output**
- Each neuron: weighted sum + bias + activation function

### 🧪 Example

Spam detection from email features (e.g., number of links, specific keywords)

## 2. Why Use CNNs for Images?

### 💡 Key Points

- Regular NNs don’t scale well for high-dimensional inputs like images.
- CNNs leverage spatial structure (nearby pixels are related).
- Drastically fewer parameters due to weight sharing.

## 3. CNN Architecture: Building Blocks

### 🧱 Main Components

#### 1. Convolution Layer

- Applies filters to detect patterns (edges, textures)
- Outputs a **feature map**

#### 2. ReLU Activation

- Introduces non-linearity: `ReLU(x) = max(0, x)`

#### 3. Pooling Layer

- Downsamples input (typically with Max Pooling)
- Reduces size, keeps essential features

#### 4. Fully Connected Layer

- Final classification layer using dense neurons

## 4. How CNN Sees an Image

### 🔄 Processing Steps

1. **Input**: Raw image
2. **Conv layer**: Feature extraction
3. **ReLU**: Non-linear transformation
4. **Pooling**: Dimensionality reduction
5. **Conv + Pool (repeat)**: Learn complex features
6. **Flatten**: Convert to vector
7. **Dense Layer**: Classify the image
